## RoboCon2021 Banners for Github

Here are some banners for your Github profile page. Github has a somewhat secret, or at last not widely know, profile page customization. If your account has a repository as the same name as the account, its README.md will display on the profile page of the account.

Here is an example:

<img alt="Sample Github profile page, https://github.com/emanlove, with customization" src="https://github.com/emanlove/robocon2021-banners/blob/master/doc/assets/img/sample-github-profile-page-emanlove.png">

Note, the repository name must match the acount name ("emanlove" for my account)and not the displayed name (which is "Ed Manlove" on my profile). Next, it must be a markdown extension, as in README._md_, and not some other markup language.

For my profile page I have a simple README.md file with just the image link.

```markdown
<img align="left" alt="I'm attending RoboCon 2021. See robocon.io to sign up!" src="https://github.com/emanlove/emanlove/blob/master/assets/img/Github-Attending-SignUp.png">
```

(Please put/copy the image you use to your repo and don't reference either my repo nor this repository. Thanks!)

#### Size Guideline

Looking at a reference site I judged a good size for the banner to be 900 pixels or px wide and 220px in height. This worked well on a 13" laptop, as well as, a 27" monitor. At this time Github seems to set the main body width to be 900px.

#### References

I want to give thanks to Florian Kromer for it was on Florian's Github profle page that I saw his customizations and learned of this cool feature. You can check out his profile [here](https://github.com/fkromer) and the [raw README.md there](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fkromer/fkromer/main/README.md).

More information about this feature can be found [within the GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/about-your-profile).
